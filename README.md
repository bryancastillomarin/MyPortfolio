# My Portfolio 📃

Hello I'm Bryan Castillo Marín and this is my portfolio.

# Frontend 🖥️

This project was created with HTML5, SASS and vanilla JavaScript:
* It makes requests (using promises) to a RESTful API to get data about my other projects and skills.
* It is a fully responsive website thanks to flexbox.
* It has both light and dark modes.
* It is a multi-language website (english and spanish).

# Backend ⚙️

The API was created with MySQL and PHP:

* By the time, it only responses to GET requests.
* It awaits any request and then it responses in JSON format.
